# Usage

[中文](USAGE_CN.md)

Just describe what you want:

```
Create a microservices e-commerce architecture with API Gateway, auth/user/order/product/payment services,
Kafka message queue, notification service, and separate databases for each service
```

The agent will generate the `.drawio` XML file and export it to PNG automatically.

## Example

**Prompt:**
> Create a microservices e-commerce architecture with Mobile/Web/Admin clients, API Gateway,
> Auth/User/Order/Product/Payment services, Kafka message queue, Notification service,
> and User DB / Order DB / Product DB / Redis Cache / Stripe API

**Output:**

## Topology demos

The skill handles various diagram topologies with clean edge routing — no lines crossing through shapes.

### Star topology (7 nodes)

Central message broker with 6 microservices radiating outward. Edges enter Kafka from different sides, zero crossings.

### Layered flow (10 nodes, 4 tiers)

E-commerce architecture with 2 cross-connections: Order→Product (same-tier horizontal) and Auth→Redis (diagonal via routing corridor). All edges route cleanly.

### Ring / cycle (8 nodes)

CI/CD pipeline with a closed loop and 2 spur branches. Edges flow along the perimeter without crossing the interior.
