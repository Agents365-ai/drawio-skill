"""Deterministic structural linter for .drawio files.

Catches the class of mistakes a vision self-check is slow and unreliable at:
dangling edge endpoints, duplicate or reserved ids, broken parent references,
and (as warnings) off-grid geometry, overlapping sibling nodes, and edge
routing defects. Runs without launching draw.io, so it is a fast pre-check
before the visual review step.

  python3 validate.py diagram.drawio

Edge routing checks (warnings): an edge segment crossing a non-incident leaf
vertex ("routes through vertex"), and two edges crossing each other ("edges X
and Y cross") — the two defects the SKILL.md step-5 self-check looks for
("Edge-shape overlap", "Stacked edges"), but caught here deterministically.

Routing is only knowable from the XML when an edge carries explicit waypoints
(``<Array as="points">``) — exactly the hand-routed case the SKILL.md tells
authors to use to route around shapes. Edges with no waypoints are auto-routed
by draw.io at render time (the path is not stored), so they are NOT geometry-
checked here, keeping these warnings free of false positives. Endpoints honour
``exitX/exitY``/``entryX/entryY`` when present, else the node centre, and
absolute positions are resolved through parent containers.

Exit status is non-zero when any error (or, with --strict, any warning) is
found, so it can gate a workflow. Compressed (non-XML) diagram pages are
skipped with a warning — this skill always writes uncompressed XML.

Usage: python3 validate.py <file.drawio> [--strict]
